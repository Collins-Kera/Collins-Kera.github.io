                        <h2>About Orthodontics</h2>
                        <p>The goal of orthodontics is to create a beautiful smile and a correctly fitting bite.  A good bite is 
                        necessary for you to bite, chew, and speak correctly.  There are a variety of ways to achieve these 
                        goals.  These options include traditional metal braces, tooth colored braces, clear aligners 
                        (Invisalign), retainers, and other orthodontic appliances as appropriate.  Dr. Summers spends time 
                        with each of his patients to create a treatment plan specifically for their individual needs.  He will take 
                        your unique needs and wishes into consideration when recommending the best treatment option for you.</p>
